 Used to track whether the application came into the foreground during startup from a background state.
 There are many reason's why an application's launch sequence might be initiated and the app not be brought to the foreground.
 One example might be a user notification response that can be handled in the background. This action triggers the
 didFinishLaunchingNotification. In a normal user initiated start, the application state when the
 application is brought to the foreground is `inActive`. But in the notification response case, it will be `background`.
 We can set this flag to do additional calculation adjustments.
