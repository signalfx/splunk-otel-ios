# ``SplunkAgent``

The Splunk RUM agent for iOS provides Real User Monitoring (RUM) capabilities for your native iOS applications.

> :construction: This project is currently in **ALPHA**. It is **officially supported** by Splunk. However, breaking changes **MAY** be introduced.

## Overview

The agent automatically instruments your application to capture performance metrics, crashes, user interactions, and more. All interactions with the agent are primarily done through the ``SplunkRum`` instance returned during installation.

Getting started is simple: you add the package, provide an ``AgentConfiguration``, and install the agent by calling the `SplunkRum.install(with:)` method. From there, you can customize which modules are active and how they behave using the agent instance you've retained.

## Getting Started

To begin integrating the agent into your app, start with our step-by-step guide.
